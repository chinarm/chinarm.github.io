				<p>Hi, I am Chinar. I am an engineer turned communications researcher interested in all things technology - but particularly, its cultures, histories, and ways of being in society.</p>
				<p>I channel my energies towards simplifying complicated research in science, tech, and the social sciences for a different kinds of audiences.</p> 
				<p>Let's discuss how I can help with your research projects. Email me at <a title="Email chinar.mehta93@gmail.com" href="mailto:chinar.mehta93@gmail.com" target="_blank">chinar [dot] mehta93 [at] gmail [dot] com</a>.</p>

				<p>My doctoral research is about how knowledge-in-practice is inscribed on web interfaces - for which I draw theory from Science &amp; Technology Studies, Feminist Cultural Studies of Science, and New Media Studies. In other words, I follow web developers &amp; managers around and ask them to explain what they do (and how they do it) in great detail.</p>

				<p>Previously, I worked with Dr Sarah Fox for 9 months on the project Future of Transit Work that examines how transit work will transform as autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is applied to the complex operating environment of public transit.</p>
