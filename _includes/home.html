	<p>Hi, I am Chinar. I am interested in all things technology - but particularly, its cultures, histories, and ways of being in society. I am a Ph.D. scholar at the Department of Communication at the University of Hyderabad and previously a Fulbright Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University. </p>
	<p>My doctoral research is about how knowledge-in-practice is inscribed on web interfaces - for which I draw theory from Science &amp; Technology Studies, Feminist Cultural Studies of Science, and New Media Studies. In other words, I follow web developers &amp; managers around and ask them to explain what they do (and how they do it) in great detail.</p>
	<p>I was also part of <a href="https://femlab.co/" target="_blank">FemLab.co</a>, a research project that aims to understand the communicative practices of women workers in India and Bangladesh so that digital tools can be leveraged for their collectivization.</p>
	<p>I channel my energies into creative ways to get research to a broader audience - through media productions like documentary films, podcasts, radio, and others. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:chinar.dac@gmail.com" target="_blank">chinar [dot] dac [at] gmail [dot] com</a>.</p>
